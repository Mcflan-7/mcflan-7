# Hello 👋

I’m **Gaëtan**, a software developer and CTO at [Front Desk](https://front-desk.app), a French startup specializing in creating digital tools for the hospitality industry.

## Who am I? 👨‍💻 

I started my career in the hospitality industry before transitioning to software development in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic.  

In 2020, I graduated from a one-year intensive IT program with [OpenClassrooms](https://openclassrooms.com/fr/paths/518-developpeur-dapplication-python) in Paris, France. Today, I work as the CTO at Front Desk, combining my passion for tech and hospitality.
